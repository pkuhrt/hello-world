Hi Humans!
Language is an imperfect thing, George-Spencer had a good idea, we have to unlearn quite a few things for getting the basis to build up more perfect. This process of learn and unlearn is vital to get any further. The question is, what to unlearn and when to unlearn. How are we able to figure that out? What are the criteria, events and parameters to trigger unlearning what?
